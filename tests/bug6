    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted tonight to give Puerto Rico what could be its best chance in 100 years of becoming the 51st State. After rejecting an effort by opponents to scuttle the bill with an English-only provision, the House voted 209-208 to hold a special referendum in Puerto Rico this year.
