	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers
reached tentative agreement today on a new local contract at a key
parts plant near Milwaukee, averting a threatened strike. In a
joint statement, the two sides said the new agreement will
``provide long-term job security ... while maintaining the
competitiveness of the plant in the marketplace.'' Details of the
pact were not released, pending meetings with the 870
UAW-represented workers and a ratification vote later this week,
said Dan Dolan, spokesman for GM's Delphi Energy & Engine
Management Systems unit. Health and safety, subcontracting and job
security were the key issues in the dispute at the Oak Creek, Wis.,
plant.
