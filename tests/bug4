    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vernon Jordan appeared today for several hours
before the grand jury investigating President Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. Jordan emerged and hailed his ``enduring
friendship'' with Clinton. ``I answered all of their questions
truthfully and completely, to the best of my ability,'' the prominent
Washington lawyer and longtime civil rights figure declared.
