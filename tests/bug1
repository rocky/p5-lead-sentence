ATLANTA (AP) _ Prayers and marches are planned across the nation today
to honor slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Vice
President Al Gore planned to visit the Atlanta church where the
Rev. King once preached, reportedly to announce a civil rights
initiative the Clinton administration will present to Congress. The
proposal would raise civil rights spending from $516 million to $602
million in the 1999 budget, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the
Los Angeles Times reported today.
