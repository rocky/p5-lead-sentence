    JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. Congressional delegation, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, will meet this week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said Rep. Henry Waxman. Waxman, who is traveling with Gingrich in Israel, said the meeting would be in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Wednesday. According to the Haaretz newspaper, Gingrich's cancellation of his planned visit to the controversial proposed site of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem paved the way for the meeting. Gingrich called off the visit in the wake of protests from Palestinians and pressure from the White House.
