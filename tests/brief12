    WASHINGTON (AP) &#151; Warning again of a possible military attack
on Iraq, top Clinton administration officials Tuesday sought the
cooperation of Saudi Arabia. As Defense Secretary William Cohen flew
to Saudi Arabia and met with King Fahd, Vice President Al Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made separate telephone calls to
Crown Prince Abdallah. Meanwhile, the State Department cautioned
Americans living and traveling abroad that with tensions increasing,
``we cannot discount the possibility of random, anti-American violence
in the event of military actions.''
