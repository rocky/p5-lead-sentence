NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dylan family -- Bob and son Jakob -- netted five
Grammys while veteran folk rocker Shawn Colvin won two of the night's
biggest awards, song and record of the year, for ``Sunny Came Home.''
As the music world bestowed its top honors, Bob Dylan, less than a
year after he suffered a life-threatening heart infection, won best
album and best contemporary folk album for ``Time Out of Mind.'' A
song from that album, ``Cold Iron Bound,'' also was honored as best
rock song. Jakob Dylan won as a composer of the best rock song, ``One
Headlight,'' performed by his band, the Wallflowers.
