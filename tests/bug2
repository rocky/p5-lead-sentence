    WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``We obviously have serious questions,'' said James P. Rubin, spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, about the Baghdad agreement brokered today between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and U.N. Chief Kofi Annan. Rubin said the Clinton administration is ``looking for actions, not words'' from Saddam, as the diplomats in Baghdad attempted to settle the dispute over arms sites, and avert a U.S. attack on Iraq. Meanwhile the Pentagon started a call-up of reserves in case they're needed for a strike against Iraq. Earlier, Albright said Washington would act alone against Iraq if any agreement made by Annan jeopardizes U.S. interests.
