	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's antitrust chief
said Tuesday Boeing Co. must rethink its exclusive supplier
arrangements if it hopes to win EU approval for a proposed merger
with McDonnell Douglas Corp. Karel Van Miert said the EU's
executive agency is seeking ``a remedy from the company that
satisfies us.'' He made his remarks to a committee of the EU's
legislative body. EU officials contend the merger would be
anticompetitive in the global civilian aircraft market, in which a
combined Boeing-McDonnell would have one major competitor: Europe's
Airbus Industrie.
