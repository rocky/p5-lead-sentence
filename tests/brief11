AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Fred Couple shot a 71 today in the third round of
the Masters, leaving him in first place at 6-under-par 210, two
strokes ahead of Phil Mikelson, Paul Azinger and Mark O'Meara. With the
wind still swirling but with considerably less force, many made
moves, including O'Meara, who shot a 68, and Azinger and Mickelson,
who both turned in a scorecard with a 69.
