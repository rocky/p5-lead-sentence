	BEIJING (AP) _ Defense Secretary William Cohen today warned China
that 
providing weapons technology to Iran could have a damaging political effect 
on China's relations with the United States and the West. Cohen said
China's 
defense minister assured him that China would not export anti-ship cruise 
missiles or nuclear technology to Iran. The United States fears Iran is 
developing a nuclear weapons capability. Earlier, Cohen signed a U.S.-China 
agreement designed to avoid conflicts at sea.
