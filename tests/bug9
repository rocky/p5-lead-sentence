    WASHINGTON (AP) &#151; A House committee has voted to cite Attorney General Janet Reno for contempt of Congress. The vote was prompted by Reno's refusal to turn over a report recommending she seek an independent counsel to probe campaign fund-raising abuses. The panel moved to the confrontation on a partisan 24-19 vote. The full House would have to endorse any contempt citation in a vote that would not occur before September when the lawmakers return from their August recess.
